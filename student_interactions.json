The most common one is:\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n```\n\nEach statement in C must end with a semicolon (;). This is really important and a common source of beginner mistakes.

I'll break this down into an easy-to-understand solution.\n\nHere's a well-structured Stack class in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Stack:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize an empty list to store stack elements\n        self.items = []\n    \n    def push(self, item):\n        # Add an item to the top of the stack\n        self.items.append(item)\n    \n    def pop(self):\n        # Remove and return the top item from the stack\n        if not self.is_empty():\n            return self.items.pop()\n        return None\n    \n    def peek(self):\n        # Look at the top item without removing it\n        if not self.is_empty():\n            return self.items[-1]\n        return None\n    \n    def is_empty(self):\n        # Check if the stack is empty\n        return len(self.items) == 0\n    \n    def size(self):\n        # Return the number of items in the stack\n        return len(self.items)\n```\n\nHere's a simple example of how to use it:\n\n```python\n# Create a new stack\nmy_stack = Stack()\n\n# Add some items\nmy_stack.push(1)\nmy_stack.push(2)\nmy_stack.push(3)\n\n# Check the top item\nprint(my_stack.peek())  # Output: 3\n\n# Remove an item\nprint(my_stack.pop())   # Output: 3\n\n# Check size\nprint(my_stack.size())  # Output: 2\n```\n\nEach method has a specific purpose:\n- `push()` adds items to the stack\n- `pop()` removes and returns the top item\n- `peek()` lets you look at the top item without removing it\n- `is_empty()` checks if the stack is empty\n- `size()` tells you how many items are in the stack\n\nWould you like to try using this stack implementation with some different examples?",

Here's what makes it special:\n\n Key Features:\n- Easy to read and write (it looks almost like English!)\n- Perfect for beginners (but powerful enough for experts)\n- Free and open-source (anyone can use it!)\n\n What can you make with Python?\n- Websites\n- Games\n- AI and Machine Learning projects\n- Data analysis\n- Mobile apps\n- And lots more!\n\nHere's a super simple example of Python code:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, I'm learning Python!\")\n```\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Learn more about what you can build with Python?\n2. See some more simple Python examples?\n3. Know how to get started with Python?\n\nJust let me know what interests you most, and I'll guide you there! \n\nRemember, everyone starts somewhere, and Python is a great choice for beginning your programming journey!

    "question": "Tell me about Classes",
    "answer": "Let me explain classes in a way that'll be easy to understand verbally, since you learn best through auditory explanations!\n\nThink of a class like a blueprint or a template. Let me use a real-world example you can relate to:\n\nImagine you're designing a Car  \n\nA class would be like the blueprint that describes:\n1. What properties a car has (like color, model, speed)\n2. What actions a car can do (like start, stop, accelerate)\n\nHere's how we might say it out loud:\n```java\nclass Car {\n    // Properties (also called attributes)\n    String color;\n    String model;\n    int speed;\n\n    // Actions (also called methods)\n    void start() {\n        // car starting code\n    }\n    void stop() {\n        // car stopping code\n    }\n}\n```\n\nQuick question to check if you're with me: Can you think of any other properties a car might have that we could add to our class? \n\nSome key points to remember about classes:\n- They're like containers that group related things together\n- They're the foundation of object-oriented programming\n- You can create multiple objects from one class (just like you can build many cars from one blueprint)\n\nWould you like me to explain more about how we can actually use this class to create car objects? Or would you prefer to learn about different aspects of classes?",

Let me explain why Python might actually be more helpful than you think, especially since I can tell you're someone who prefers to learn through discussion and hearing things out.\n\n Let's talk this through:\n\n1. Python is actually known as one of the most beginner-friendly languages because:\n   - It reads almost like English\n   - You don't need to worry about complex syntax like semicolons or curly braces\n   - You can create working programs with very few lines of code\n\n2. Consider these real-world applications:\n   - Instagram is largely built with Python\n   - Netflix uses Python for its recommendation system\n   - NASA uses Python for scientific computing\n\n3. Job Market Reality:\n   - Python developers are among the highest-paid programmers\n   - It's consistently in the top 3 most in-demand programming languages\n\nHowever, I'm curious - what made you feel this way about Python? Understanding your perspective would help me better address your concerns and maybe show you some aspects you might find more appealing.\n\nWould you like to share what specifically makes you feel Python isn't a good language to learn?

Early Life & Education:\n- Studied law in London\n- Worked as a lawyer in South Africa, where he first developed his peaceful protest methods\n\n2. Famous Movements:\n- Led the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-1922)\n- The famous Salt March or Dandi March (1930)\n- Quit India Movement (1942)\n\n3. His Core Principles:\n- Ahimsa (Non-violence) \n- Satyagraha (Truth force)\n- Simple living\n- Self-reliance (promoted khadi/handspun cloth)\n\n4. Freedom Struggle:\n- Unified Indians in the fight for independence\n- Used peaceful protests and civil disobedience\n- Helped India gain independence in 1947\n\n5. Legacy:\n- Known as the \"Father of the Nation\" in India\n- Influenced leaders like Martin Luther King Jr.\n- His birthday (October 2) is celebrated as International Day of Non-Violence\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these points?
